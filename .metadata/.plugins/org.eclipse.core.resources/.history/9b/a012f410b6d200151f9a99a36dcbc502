/**
 * 2-13-16
 * At this precise moment in time, you have just finished a 12+ hour shift at St. Johns Mercy hospital.
 * I am at home crying at how incredible God's love & blessings are - how wonderful you are to me.
 * You are the most amazing blessing I could ever ask for; you are simply too good to be true.
 * Your first gift to me is simply priceless; it means more to me than all the riches in the world.
 * Yet as incredible your gift is and all that it signifies, nothing can compare to how much you mean to me.
 * I stand in awe of the most amazing woman, and wonder why God would ever bless me with the honor to love & serve you.
 * No matter what happens, no matter what comes our way, I will love you 'til the day I die.
 * That is not by my means, but by the power of God
 * I have thought and thought and thought about how I could portray my love to you, yet everything seems to be in vain.
 * I feel as though there is nothing that could come close to exemplifying how much you mean to me and how much I love you!
 * The only thing I can say that comes close, is that I will seek after Christ first in our relationship.
 * Then from that, I will be able to best love and serve you through the love of Christ!
 * I wish to be able to love and serve you as Christ did His bride.
 * I desire to give my wants, my desires - myself - up for you: to die to myself daily.
 * That I might sanctify you you, grow together and cleanse you by the washing of water with the Word.
 * That I might one day present you before our heavenly Father, in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.
 * That you might be holy and without blemish.
 * I really don't know how else I could love you more fully.
 * I cherish you dearly; I care for you so deeply & want the very, very best for you.
 * I always want what is best for you in the long haul - eternity - not just the here and now.
 * I don't know how I could possibly give you a better gift than the one you gave me.
 * I have never received such an amazing, heart-felt gift in my life; thank you so much, Jerusha!
 * The only thing that I can think of to remotely give you back something in return, is to utilize the gifts God has given me.
 * So, I have created a program for you, which I hope will manifest my love to you in some small fraction of it all!
 * (I'm very sorry you have to deal with my geeky nerdyness ;)
 * 
 * @author Yours Truly,
 * Matt Campbell
