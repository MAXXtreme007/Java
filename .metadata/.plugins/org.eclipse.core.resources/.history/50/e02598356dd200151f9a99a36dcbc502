/*
 Purpose:The program will calculate the sum of
 every integer between a given starting number
 and a given ending number from the user.

 Ask the user if he wishes to calculate the total sum of
 the numbers by using a loop method or by a simple formula
 of addition.

 Allow the user to define two integersâ€”one starting number
 and one ending number. Either integer may be the minimum
 or the maximum, but the summation must calculate the
 integers between the two. i.e. the summation may be
 "forwards" or "backwards".

 Display a message with the calculated total sum back to the user.

 Also with this lab, this program has a generated javadoc file.
